This repository contains the official paper for μ² Tokenizer, a novel approach for automated radiology report generation (RRG) introduced in the paper "μ² Tokenizer: Differentiable Multi-Scale Multi-Modal Tokenizer for Radiology Report Generation".

Our proposed model, μ²LLM, leverages a multi-scale, multi-modal architecture to generate accurate and clinically salient radiology reports from CT scans.

## 👋 Introduction

<img src="./assets/ullm.svg">

we introduce μ²LLM, a multi-scale multimodal large language model. At its core is the novel μ² Tokenizer, an intermediate layer that intelligently fuses visual features from CT scans with textual information. The model is further refined using Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), guided by the specialized medical report evaluation metric, GREEN, to ensure the generated reports align with expert standards.

Our experimental results on four large-scale CT datasets show that μ²LLM outperforms existing methods, highlighting its potential for generating high-quality radiology reports even with limited training data.

## 🚀 Quickstart
Here, we can easily use our model based on Hugging Face.

## 🤖 Model Setup

We use Python 3.10.16 for this project and the library requirements are given in requirements.txt. Create a conda environment using

```
conda create --name <env> --file requirements.txt
```

Ensure that the NVIDIA CUDA version 11.8 or above to be compatible with PyTorch 2.2.2.


The trained checkpoints for our model is available here:
